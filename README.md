# INDOESTRI
INDOESTRI is a mobile application that allows users to browse and register for workshops held by an Indonesia-based makerspace, Indoestri. INDOESTRI is designed to keep the user updated with their newly announced workshops as well as to register for their favourite workshops quickly.

Indoestri lists the upcoming workshops and allows the user to click on a specific workshop to read its full details. Additionally, the favourite button feature allows the user to save the workshop that they are interested in and get back to it quickly using the tab bar. As the workshops sell out pretty quickly, users have the option to be notified whenever a new workshop is announced.
